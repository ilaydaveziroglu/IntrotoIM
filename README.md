Hamilton reading response:


I really enjoyed the reading because I found it really empowering for females. Even to this day, females are not very welcomed in the computer and coding fields. It is really impressive that she achieved all of this back in the 1960s as a female and a working mom. It is really annoying that this is the reality but these stigmas need to be broken soon. Ever since the 1960s, we took a couple of steps forward but this needs to be faster because there are many intelligent females that are being stopped just because they are females.
