Reading Repsonse for Golan Levin



My main takeaway of this reading is that since the beginning of computer interactive art, the computer has been one of its most powerful tools.  The reading goes through a bit of the history of computer vision and interactive art and it mentions that one of the first computer interactive art performance was made using computer vision. Lately, in the reading, it is also mentioned that experts are still working to improve the algorithms to make computer vision more efficient. Hence, this means that computer vision was a cornerstone technique in interactive art and that there are still things to explore in computer vision. The first project that showcased the use of computer vision in interactive art was Myron Kruegerâ€™s Videoplace, and despite being first conceived in the early 1970s it seems to hold a lot in common with several modern digital art installations.  I also considered how there could be endless applications for this kind of creative technology, which could generate revolutionary changes in the fields of education, architecture, media, art, etc.
