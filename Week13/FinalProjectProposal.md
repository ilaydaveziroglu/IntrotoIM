Final Project Proposal


INTRODUCTION:
I would like to do a game similar to whac-a-mole where you will have a buttons to control it. I was imagining that with Processing, I can display the 'moles' on the screen and with the help of Arduino, I can have buttons that you will push when the moles appear on the screen. It will have five holes with diffferent colors on the screen and I will have five respective buttons with different colors for the holes. The player will try to press on the right button when a 'mole' apperars inside a hole. Every level will have 10-12 moles popping up and the player will have the freedom to give two wrong answers before they ran out of lives. I'm want to go for an old look like the game console in the 1980s. So if it is possible I want the game visuals to be in big pixels.

THINGS I NEED:
It will require a computer screen and then, it will have some button in the front. I need some wood and big buttons to make it look like gam econsole. Maybe a smaller version of it. For my project I need couple buttons with the Arduino. I suppose I have everything I need in my kit.

DESCRIPTION OF MY PROGRAMS:
My Processing program will be displaying the holes and the moles on the screen and it will also dispaly the score board up top. There will be different levels, after hitting 10-12 moles, the player will advance to the next level. Every level, the moles will change location faster. My Arduino program will be talking to the Processing program and reporting back if the right button is pressed.

THINGS I DON'T KNOW/AREA OF CONCERNS:
I don't know how to keep the score board for the game and I don't know how to asses if the player is making mistakes so I can end the game or give them another try. I think I'm concerned about the whole coding part, I don't think I have a specific concern other than. I don't know where to start with the whole project.
