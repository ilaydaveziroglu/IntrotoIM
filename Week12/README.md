Week 12 writing assignment


Write (in your Github repository) at least three paragraphs about what computing means to you at this point. Reflect on the conversations weâ€™ve had in class, and look critically at your relationship with computing.
Is it adding something to your life?
Is it helping you become a better person?
What are you getting out of it, what do others get from it?

I'm still not super familiar with coding and I don't feel comfortable writing things down. I've never been a computer savy person and these couple weeks that I have been learning were really hard. Because I'm also doing Communications Lab at the same time so that was a lot of different language at the same for me to learn. I'm genuinely glad that I'm learning this at the point in my life. I might seem a bit late to learn because people who are good at coding or with computers in general start learning about this super early. I feel like I'm behind everyone in class because most of the people have a background or an interest in it somehow.

Even though, feeling bad about myself there are couple reasons why I'm glad that I'm learning these right now. In the world that we live in, we depend on computing and codes to do thigns for us and make our lives easier. I believe that every day we rely more and more. So, learning more and more make me feel like I'm understanding the world around me more and more. I start to get a sense of thigns around more easily. I don't know if it is making me a better person particularly, but definetly it is making me feel better and get a grasp of the world that I live in.

Overall, I'm struggling but I'm trying to push through to understand because I like the feeling when I start understanding things. I like being able to do things that I coudn't before. I believe that this is a really valuable skill to have, so when I feel frustrated I try to keep that in sight.
