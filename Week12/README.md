Week 12 writing assignment


Write (in your Github repository) at least three paragraphs about what computing means to you at this point. Reflect on the conversations weâ€™ve had in class, and look critically at your relationship with computing.
Is it adding something to your life?
Is it helping you become a better person?
What are you getting out of it, what do others get from it?

I'm still not super familiar with coding and I don't feel comfortable writing things down. I've never been a computer savy person and these couple weeks that I have been learning were really hard. Because I'm also doing Communications Lab at the same time so that was a lot of different language at the same for me to learn.
